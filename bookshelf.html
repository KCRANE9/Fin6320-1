<li>Learning Python by programming some basic games is a lot of fun.</li>
<li>You will learn <strong><em>real</em></strong> Python programming from this book!</li>
<li>Very similar to its C++ counterpart.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="">Python 3 a Complete Reference</a>
<ul>
<li>A great book.</li>
<li>Blah blah blah</li>
</ul></li>

<li><a href="">Beginning C++ Through Game Programming</a>
<ul>
<li>Teaches <strong><em>real</em></strong> C++ programming!</li>
<li>Avoids technical jargon.</li>
<li>A lot of fun!</li>
<li>I really enjoy Dawson's teaching style. He keeps it as simple as possible.</li>
<li>This books shows that really anyone can learn to program in C++.</li>
