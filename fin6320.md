## Syllabus


### Course Description

This course is an introduction to numerical programming for finance. This is a very applied course by nature.
Although there will often be class lectures that focus on bits of theory, they will always be followed by
computational exercises that focus on implementation. The computational tools that we refer to have two
dimensions: 1) the mathematical tools that form _numerical analysis_ that are helpful for solving problems in
finance, and 2) the actual implementation of said tools in a programming language. We will take a mixed language
approach to financial computing focusing on the Python and C++ programming languages, though we will mention
and compare other approaches. The focus will be applied in nature and will focus on "getting things done" rather than on
theoretical computer science. I will not attempt to teach you all of either Python or C++, but only those parts of the
languages that are helpful for computational finance (a sort of super best parts approach). We will also learn some
techniques of modern software engineering that are helpful for producing reliable and reproducible research. This course
will lay a foundation for a career in computational finance or advanced research in finance at the doctoral level.


### Course Objectives

- Develop specific skills, competencies and points of view needed by professionals in the finance industry and in
  academic finance.
	+ Learn the basics of Python and C++ programming for financial computing.
	+ Develop computational skills necessary to implement theories from moder financial economics in practice.
- Learning fundamental principles and theories.
	+ Learn theories of advanced derivatives pricing.
	+ Learn the concepts of numerical methods useful in computational finance.
	+ Learn theories of advanced econometric methods.
- Learning to apply course materials.
	+ Learn to implement derivative pricing models for applications in trading and hedging.
	+ Learn to apply theories of advanced econometrics to estimate volatility and to measure transactions costs.


### Textbooks

There is only one required textbook for this course:

- [Simulation, Fifth Edition](https://goo.gl/6x7eFw)

I do however, suggest the following books (though they are not strictly _required_). I will be presenting material for class lectures based on them:

- [Cython](https://goo.gl/mdSauz)
- [Professional C++ 3rd Edition](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781118858059.do)

I will provide my suggested reading lists for Python, C++, and numerical methods in the [Bookshelf](bookshelf.html).


### Assessment and Grading

The grade that you earn in this course will be determined by your ranking in the class based on the weighted total
points accumulated on class preparation and participation, a class project, and a final exam. There is no predetermined
percentage of the class that will earn an A, or that will fail. If you all do excellent work, you will all earn high
marks. The weights given to each part of the class are as follows:

- Class preparation, participation, and homework (30%) - I expect each student to come to class prepared for each class
  session. Preparation includes completing the assigned readings, writing down questions for sections of the reading
  that were not fully understood or internalized, and completing homework assignments. Class participation is crucial
  for understanding. I will call on students in class. There are two good answers when called upon. The first correct
  response is an informed answer based on your preparation. The second correct response is a question that shows that
  you have wrestled with the material in your preparations, though you may not yet have mastered it. A good question
  often lays the foundation for a more complete understanding. One important aspect of class participation is the
  professionalism with which you conduct yourself. I will drop your lowest homework assignment and replace it with the
  average of the other assignments, BUT only if I deem it of sufficient quality and effort. 

- Final project (45%) - The class project consists of a computational exercise in implementing a derivatives pricing
  model or econometric technique in Python/C++. Further details of the project will be given in the near future. You may
  work in teams of two. I would like to know during the first week of class who your partner is. I am happy to make a
  market in arranging teams if that helps. The final deliverable for your project will be a GitHub repository together
  with a simple web cite showcasing your project. Further details will be given about Git, GitHub, and how to make a
  basic website using Markdown and GitHub Pages. You will be surprised at how easy it can actually be. I expect this
  form of a deliverable to be very helpful in enhancing your resume and portfolio for potential employers.  

- Final exam (25%) - The final exam will consist of a timed take-home computational exercise similar to homework
  assignments. Any day during finals week you can check out the exam from me by email or in person. You will then be
  required to check in the completed problems with the accompanying source code to a private GitHub repository before the time limit expires. 


### Format and Attendance

This course is designed to be as interactive and hands-on during class sessions as possible. I will deliver lectures
during a live web session that you can "attend" online by joining the web conference through your browser. Lectures will
be recorded automatically for your review. Lectures will be delivered at regularly scheduled dates and times. In
addition, I will meet with two smaller groups of students during mentoring sessions during regularly scheduled times. I
will also be available for online and in-person office hours. My experience has been that face-to-face time with
students is crucial to the learning process, but that we usually fill that time with the least effective use of that
time. Instead I would like to use that time most effectively to help you learn how to solve computational problems in
finance with hands-on coaching and to automate or nearly automate the more mundane material. An added benefit is that
lectures will be recorded for your review. In addition, I would like to hold a few "pair programming" exercises with
smaller groups of students during the semester. I will show you the technology that we will be using to accomplish this
task. 

Attendance becomes essential in this approach. I will allow for a few missed online lectures, where you can review the
recorded lecture. But the face-to-face meetings become crucial for success in this class. I will often collect a list of
questions from each of you at the beginning of face time sessions, and may also give some simple quizzes on rare
occasions. 


### Software Tools

We will be using the following programming and software resources in this class:

- All class communication will take place [Slack](https://slack.com), a message system that replaces email, instant
  message, etc that is often used by software engineering teams. I think it is important that we use real-world tools.
  Students will receive an invitation to join the [Fin 6320 Slack channel](https://fin6320.slack.com) during the first
  week of class. 
- We will be using [GitHub](https://github.com) for software version control and for collaborative projects. Students
  should sign up for the [free educational account at GitHub](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new).
  Students will turn all homework assignments into a GitHub repository. Further details will be given. See [Exploring
  Git and GitHub](git.md) for additional information.
- The first programming environment that we will use will be the [Cloud9 IDE](https://c9.io) for both Python and C++. Further details
  will be given. 
- In addition, students will receive a login to a Linux server that I maintain for computational research that contains
  all of the software tools and utilities that we will need. In a future lecture I will demonstrate how to connect to
  and use the system. This will help us streamline the difficulties of getting students set up with all of the different
  tools on their own systems (though I will aid students who wish to do so). 
- We will also learn about modern reporting using document processing tools such as Jupyter Notebooks, Pandoc, LaTeX,
  and Markdown. The use of Microsoft Word is ___not___ allowed in Fin6320! For additional information see [Document
  Processing](docs.md). 
- In addition to the Canvas course management system we will use a Google Drive folder for distributing documents,
  slides, etc.
